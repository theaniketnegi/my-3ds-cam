# my-3ds-cam

a simple homebrew 3ds camera app to let me take LQ photos, because my 3ds camera was broken.

will only work if your 3ds can at least still scan QRs (that's how it worked for me)

major chunk of code took from [devkit examples](https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds-examples/tree/master)

viewfinder is really slow right now.

## using
- right trigger to take a photo
- start to go back to homebrew menu

## building
pre-requisites:
- a computer
- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
- a 3ds with homebrew

clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theaniketnegi/my-3ds-cam.git
```

build the project
```bash
cd my-3ds-cam && make
```

feel free to contribute : ))
